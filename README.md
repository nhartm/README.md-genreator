## README.md generator

## Description: This is a generator that can be used to automatically create README.md files when working on your projects. 

## Usage: Open your terminal to enter the correct file path of your project. Next run 'node.index.js' and hit enter. There will be a list of questions you'll need to input and after you will have a shiny new README.md.
